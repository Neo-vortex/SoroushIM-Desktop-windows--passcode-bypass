# SoroushIM-Desktop-windows--passcode-bypass
The local passcode of the client installed on windows OS (others?) can be bypassed with window resizing .

to exploit: 

0.Make sure app is in the lock mode.

1.Compile and run the Poc.vb.

2.Close the Soroush Im window via X button (NOT VIA SYSTEM TRAY OR FORCE CLOSE).

3.Reopen and this time no passcode will be asked .

NOTE: make sure the Windows of the Sorosuh Messager should not be minimized while running Poc.

NOTE: The same result can be also reached by manual resizing in the proper form.

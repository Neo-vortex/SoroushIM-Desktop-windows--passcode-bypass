# SoroushIM-Desktop-windows--passcode-bypass
The local passcode of the client installed on windows OS (others?) can be bypassed with window resizing .

The lock screen of the app is designed to be intractive with windows resizing , but putting the window in an unpredicted situation will result the lock screen to vannish and the passcode to get bypassed

to exploit: 

0.Make sure app is in the lock mode.

1.Compile and run the Poc.vb.

2.Close the Soroush Im window via X button (NOT VIA SYSTEM TRAY OR FORCE CLOSE).

3.Reopen and this time no passcode will be asked .

NOTE: make sure the Windows of the Sorosuh Messager should not be minimized while running Poc.

NOTE: The same result can be also reached by manual resizing in the proper form.
